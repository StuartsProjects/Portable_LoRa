The **1\_LoRa\_Transmitter** and **2\_LoRa\_Receiver** examples can be used for LoRa tests such as range or distance and antenna performance or comparison. The **2_LoRa_Receiver** example acts as an RSSI meter with both RSSI and SNR displayed in large characters. These examples will also drive a small piezo buzzer to indicate packet transmission or reception.
